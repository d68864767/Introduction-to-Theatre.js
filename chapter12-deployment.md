# Chapter 12: Deploying Theatre.js Applications

Welcome to the twelfth chapter of our comprehensive guide to Theatre.js! In this chapter, we will discuss various deployment strategies, server-side considerations, and continuous integration and delivery for Theatre.js applications.

## Deployment Strategies

Deploying a Theatre.js application involves several steps, from building the application to hosting it on a server. Here are some common deployment strategies:

- **Static File Hosting**: If your Theatre.js application is a static site, you can host it on platforms like GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel. These platforms are easy to use and often offer free hosting for static sites.
- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: If your Theatre.js application uses server-side rendering, you can deploy it on a Node.js server. You can use platforms like Heroku, AWS, or Google Cloud for hosting your server.
- **Docker**: If you want to ensure that your application runs the same way in every environment, you can containerize your application using Docker. This involves creating a Dockerfile that describes how to build your application and run it in a Docker container.

## Server-Side Considerations

When deploying a Theatre.js application, there are several server-side considerations to keep in mind:

- **Node.js Version**: Ensure that the server is running a version of Node.js that is compatible with Theatre.js.
- **Environment Variables**: If your application uses environment variables, make sure they are properly set on the server.
- **Dependencies**: Ensure all dependencies are installed on the server. You can do this by running `npm install` in the root directory of your application.

## Continuous Integration and Delivery

Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD) are practices that involve automatically building, testing, and deploying your application whenever changes are made to the codebase. Here are some tools you can use for CI/CD:

- **Jenkins**: Jenkins is a popular open-source tool for CI/CD. It allows you to define pipelines for building, testing, and deploying your application.
- **Travis CI**: Travis CI is a hosted CI/CD service that integrates well with GitHub. It can automatically build and deploy your application whenever you push changes to your GitHub repository.
- **GitHub Actions**: GitHub Actions is a CI/CD service provided by GitHub. It allows you to define workflows that run whenever certain events occur in your repository.

In the next chapter, we'll dive into writing unit tests for Theatre.js applications. Stay tuned!
