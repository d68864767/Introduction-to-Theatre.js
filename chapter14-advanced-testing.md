# Chapter 14: Advanced Testing Techniques

Welcome to the fourteenth chapter of our comprehensive guide to Theatre.js! In this chapter, we will delve deeper into advanced testing techniques, including mocking and spies in tests, testing asynchronous code, and integration testing.

## Mocking and Spies in Tests

Mocking is a technique where a mock function is used to replace the actual function in order to track calls to the function and the parameters passed in those calls. Jest provides `jest.fn()` for mocking functions.

```javascript
const Theatre = require('theatre');
const mockFunction = jest.fn();

Theatre.setFunction(mockFunction);

test('Theatre function is called', () => {
  Theatre.callFunction();
  expect(mockFunction).toHaveBeenCalled();
});
```

Spies are similar to mocks but they are used when you do not want to affect the behavior of a function, but you need to record its usage. Jest provides `jest.spyOn()` for spying on functions.

```javascript
const Theatre = require('theatre');
const spy = jest.spyOn(Theatre, 'functionToSpy');

test('Theatre function is called', () => {
  Theatre.callFunction();
  expect(spy).toHaveBeenCalled();
});
```

## Testing Asynchronous Code

Asynchronous code can be tricky to test, but Jest provides several methods to make it easier. Here's an example of how to test a function that returns a promise:

```javascript
const Theatre = require('theatre');

test('Theatre function returns a promise', () => {
  return Theatre.asyncFunction().then(data => {
    expect(data).toBe('Promise resolved');
  });
});
```

## Integration Testing

Integration testing is a level of software testing where individual units are combined and tested as a group. The purpose of this level of testing is to expose faults in the interaction between integrated units.

```javascript
const Theatre = require('theatre');

test('Theatre scene integration', () => {
  const scene = Theatre.createScene();
  const character = Theatre.createCharacter();

  scene.addCharacter(character);

  expect(scene.getCharacters()).toContain(character);
});
```

In the next chapter, we will cover the detailed breakdown of all functions and modules in Theatre.js API reference.
