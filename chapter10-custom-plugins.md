# Chapter 10: Custom Plugins for Theatre.js

Welcome to the tenth chapter of our comprehensive guide to Theatre.js! In this chapter, we will explore the plugin architecture of Theatre.js, learn how to develop a simple plugin, and understand how to publish and share plugins.

## Understanding Theatre.js Plugin Architecture

Theatre.js is designed to be extensible, allowing developers to add their own functionality through plugins. A plugin in Theatre.js is a piece of code that adds new features or modifies existing ones. The plugin architecture of Theatre.js is based on a modular design, which means that each plugin is independent and can be added or removed without affecting the rest of the application.

Here are some key points about the plugin architecture:

- **Modularity**: Each plugin is a self-contained module that provides a specific functionality. This design allows for high cohesion and low coupling, making the code easier to maintain and extend.
- **Interoperability**: Plugins can interact with each other and with the core Theatre.js library. This allows for complex behaviors and interactions.
- **Lifecycle Hooks**: Plugins can hook into the lifecycle of Theatre.js objects, such as scenes and characters, to modify their behavior or add new features.

## Developing a Simple Plugin

Let's create a simple plugin that adds a new method to our characters. This method will allow characters to "dance", which in our case will simply be a console log statement.

```javascript
// Define the plugin
const DancePlugin = {
  install(Theatre) {
    Theatre.prototype.dance = function() {
      console.log(this.name + ' is dancing!');
    };
  }
};

// Install the plugin
Theatre.use(DancePlugin);

// Now all characters can dance!
const character = new Theatre.Character('John');
character.dance(); // Logs: "John is dancing!"
```

In this example, we define a plugin `DancePlugin` that adds a `dance` method to the `Theatre` prototype. We then install the plugin using `Theatre.use()`. Now, all characters can use the `dance` method.

## Publishing and Sharing Plugins

Once you've developed a plugin, you might want to share it with other Theatre.js developers. You can do this by publishing your plugin to a package manager like npm. Here are the general steps:

1. **Prepare your plugin**: Make sure your plugin is well-documented and includes a `package.json` file with all the necessary information.
2. **Publish to npm**: Use the `npm publish` command to publish your plugin. You'll need an npm account for this.
3. **Share your plugin**: Share the npm link with others, or add it to the Theatre.js plugin directory to make it more discoverable.

That's it for this chapter! In the next chapter, we will discuss performance optimization in Theatre.js applications.
