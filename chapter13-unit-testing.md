# Chapter 13: Writing Unit Tests for Theatre.js

Welcome to the thirteenth chapter of our comprehensive guide to Theatre.js! In this chapter, we will introduce the concept of unit testing in JavaScript, set up a testing environment, and write and run tests for Theatre.js.

## Introduction to Unit Testing in JavaScript

Unit testing is a software testing method where individual units of source code are tested to determine if they are fit for use. In JavaScript, there are several libraries available for unit testing, such as Jest, Mocha, and Jasmine. For the purpose of this guide, we will be using Jest due to its simplicity and wide range of features.

## Setting Up a Testing Environment

Before we can write tests, we need to set up a testing environment. Here are the steps:

1. **Install Jest**: Jest is a JavaScript testing framework developed by Facebook. You can install Jest using npm (Node Package Manager). Open your terminal and type the following command: `npm install --save-dev jest`.

2. **Configure Jest**: Jest needs to be configured to work with Theatre.js. Create a new file in your project root named `jest.config.js` and add the following code:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  testEnvironment: 'node',
};
```

This tells Jest to use the Node.js environment for testing.

## Writing and Running Tests for Theatre.js

Now that we have our testing environment set up, we can start writing tests. In Jest, tests are written in files with the `.test.js` extension. Let's create a new file named `theatre.test.js` and write our first test:

```javascript
const Theatre = require('theatre');

test('Theatre is defined', () => {
  expect(Theatre).toBeDefined();
});
```

This test checks if the Theatre.js module is defined. To run the test, open your terminal and type the following command: `npm test`.

Jest will automatically find and run all test files in your project. If everything is set up correctly, you should see a message indicating that your test passed.

In the next chapter, we will cover advanced testing techniques, including mocking and spies in tests, testing asynchronous code, and integration testing.
